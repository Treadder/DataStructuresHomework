    /*EXPLORING DATASET
* 
*  There are some dirty rows, as you can tell by the different user id's sprinkled in the set.
* 
*  Calorie count can unexpectedly jump and fall in an entry or 2. I assume it's calorie/current minute with sensor limitations
* 
*  Distance seems to be only during the minute in question, not compounding.
* 
 TODO
* 
* A) FILTER the data that is not the target (first entry's ID should do it)         <---done!
* B) DE-DUPE the data. Search for duplicate lines I guess, and remove them.<--------done!
* C) Clean each record with missing fields
      You must open “FitbitData.csv” for mode read; check for success          <----done!

-      You must read each record in the file as a string, one line at a time; if the record does not belong to the target patient, then it should be discarded   <-----done!

-      You must parse each record into the corresponding fields, and store into the FitbitData array; note: not all fields have values, some are “empty” or null;        <--------done!
        if some of the fields are “empty” or null, then you must perform data cleansing and insert values to construct a record that is consistent with the others; the<--------done!
            data inserted should not represent valid values<--------done!

-      You must compute the total calories burned, distance walked in miles, floors walked, and steps taken            <----Done!  
    
-      You must compute average heartrate over the 24 hour period                       <------DOne!                             

-      You must report the max steps taken in one minute over the 24 hour period; if there are multiple minutes throughout the day where the max   <----Dpme!
        is discovered, then report the one that is the latest in the 24 hour period <----Dpme!

-      You must report the longest consecutive range of poor sleep; a range is defined as one or more consecutive minutes where the sleepLevel > 1;       <<<<<<<    
        the poorest sleep is not based on the length of the range, but the sum of the sleep levels in the range; the max sum of the ranges is considered 
            the poorest sleep (report the starting and ending minutes of range)          The problem is my lack of handling blank entries i think



-      You must open “Results.csv” for mode write; this will either create a new .csv or overwrite an existing one

-      You must output two lines to “Results.csv” and to the screen in the following format:

o   Line 1: Header line: Total Calories,Total Distance,Total Floors,Total Steps,Avg Heartrate,Max Steps,Sleep

o   Line 2: valueCalories,valueDistance,valueFloors,valueSteps,valueHeartrate,valueMax,valueSleepStart:valueSleepEnd

o   Lines 3 – N: the filtered, deduped, and cleansed data in the original FitbitData.csv format

-      You must close “FitbitData.csv” and “Results.csv”
